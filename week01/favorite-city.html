    <h1>Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic</h1>

     <p>Santo Domingo, formerly known as Santo Domingo de Guzm√°n, 
        is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and 
        the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population.
        As of 2022, the city center had a population of 1,029,110 while 
        its metropolitan area, Greater Santo Domingo, had a population of 4,274,651. 
        The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (D.N.),
        itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.</p>

    <p>Santo Domingo was founded in 1496 by the Spanish Empire and is the oldest 
        continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas. It was the 
        first seat of Spanish colonial rule in the New World, the Captaincy General 
        of Santo Domingo. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, 
        cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. 
        The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
        Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo, from 1936 to 1961, after 
        the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital 
        after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.</p>
    
    <p>Santo Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial 
        center of the Dominican Republic, with the vast majority of the country's 
        industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the 
        chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River 
        accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger- 
        and freight traffic.</p>
